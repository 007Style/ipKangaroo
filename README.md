# ipKangaroo

ipK is a simple chat & talk client/server based java application.

2000-2001 ipKangaroo

ipK version 5.2.2

Java runtime environment version 1.3 required, aka jre 1.3 or greater

A 200 Mhz computer is STRONGLY recommended for ipK.  ipKtalk needs a sound device, an internet connection, speakers and a microphone.  ipKchat needs an internet connection.

To start the app run ipK.bat

If you have the source; to build all files run build.bat

NOTE:  in ipKtalk, use <Compatibility Mode> only if your are experiencing difficulties.  Also, older operating systems and or audio hardware may not be fully compatible with this software; it's hit or miss.  Windows 95 users may experience difficulty.  Windows 2000, Linux 2.4 and later operating systems should function normaly.  Java runtime 1.3 or greater is REQUIRED for this software.  There are a couple of minor bugs in this release.  Most are do to the jave sound API.  If the program does crash and the user can no longer get control of the program simply close the command window that poped up with the program to close it...

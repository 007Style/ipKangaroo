ipK version 5.2.2

Java runtime environment version 1.3 required, aka jre 1.3 or greater

A 200 Mhz computer is STRONGLY recommended for ipK.  ipKtalk needs a sound device, an internet 
connection, speakers and a microphone.  ipKchat needs an internet connection.

To start the app run ipK.bat

If you have the source; to build all files run build.bat

NOTE:  in ipKtalk, use <Compatibility Mode> only if your are experiencing difficulties.
       Also, older operating systems and or audio hardware may not be fully compatible
       with this software; it's hit or miss.  Windows 95 users may experience difficulty.
       Windows 2000, Linux 2.4 and later operating systems should function normaly.
       Java runtime 1.3 is REQUIRED for this software.  There are a couple of minor bugs
       in this release.  Most are do to the jave sound API.  Even so, to report bugs email
       help@ipkangaroo.no-ip.com for assistance.  If the program does crash and the user 
       can no longer get control of the program simply close the command window that poped 
       up with the program to close it...

P.S.
I've released this code formally as open source for the internet community.  If you enjoy 
this code or incorporate any part of it into your application, please provide credit.  
Beer-ware as it were.  This project, with it's companion website was very exciting for the
time.  Many of the original contributors went on to big jobs within the industry contributing
to the internet connected world your know and love today.  

Cheers!
